Goal: Analyse the impact of LEMA implementation on well pumping (aggregate) and water table levels.




**R Packages Needed**


```r
library(tidyverse)
library(CausalImpact)
library(knitr)

# filepath to repo on local system
mainDir <- '/Users/deinesji/Documents/code_git/1phd/DeinesEtAl2019_ERL_lema1'
```

# Load Data
master data file created in the aptly named 00.40_makeMasterDataFile.Rmd


```r
dataDir <- paste0(mainDir, '/data/tabular')
masterName <- 'masterTidyData_Wide_20181018.csv'

# load
master0 <- read_csv(paste0(dataDir, '/', masterName)) 
```

```
## Parsed with column specification:
## cols(
##   .default = col_double(),
##   masterid = col_character()
## )
```

```
## See spec(...) for full column specifications.
```

```r
# add a column for presence of LEMA program
lemaKey <- data.frame(Year = 1996:2017,
                      isLema = c(rep('before',17),rep('post',5)))
master <- master0 %>% left_join(lemaKey, by = 'Year')

# make a long version of relevant variables
waterUseLong <- master %>%
  dplyr::select(c(masterid, Year, wimasVol_km3, wimasIrrArea_ha, wtElev_m,
                  wtRelative2012_m,wtRelative0_m, pr_calendar_mm, irrigated_ha,
                  aimIrr_ha, annualChange_m)) %>%
  tidyr::gather(., key = variable, value = value, wimasVol_km3:annualChange_m)

# separate regions
sheridan <- master %>% filter(masterid == 'sheridan')
null9 <- master %>% filter(masterid == 'null_geo9')


set.seed(43)
```

# Functions

## causalImpact helper fun
simplify individual runs slightly. note the intervention time is static and specific to LEMA


```r
runCausalImpact <- function(startYear,endYear, dataframe){
  # make a zoo object for row index thingy
  year <- c(startYear:endYear)
  inputZoo <- zoo(as.matrix(dataframe),  year)

  # run model (intervention year is static)
  before <- c(startYear,2012)
  after <- c(2013,endYear)
  causalModel <- CausalImpact(inputZoo, before, after)
  return(causalModel)
}
```

# Pumping Volumes
Compare aggregate pumping per region by pre-/post-LEMA periods

## Numbers


```r
master2002 <- master %>% filter(Year >= 2002)

cropMasterTable <- master2002 %>%
  dplyr::select(c(masterid, isLema, wimasVol_km3, wtElev_m, wtRelative0_m,

## Causal Impact Analysis
Using the `CausalImpact` package. the first column of the input dataframe needs to be the response variable (here, pumping), and all subsequent columns are taken as covariates

Covariates can't be affected by the intervention

### sheridan pumping
covariates: year, precipitation, aridity, corn prices. 


```r
# extract df for causalimpact
sheridanPumping <- sheridan %>% 
  filter(Year <= 2017) %>%
  dplyr::select(c(wimasVol_km3, Year, pr_calendar_mm, pr_grow_mm, pr_JanAug_mm,
                   aridity, cornPriceAdj2017)) 

# format data input and run model
sheridanModel <- runCausalImpact(1996, 2017, sheridanPumping)

# see results
plot(sheridanModel)

## Analysis report {CausalImpact}
## 
## 
## During the post-intervention period, the response variable had an average value of approx. 22.18. By contrast, in the absence of an intervention, we would have expected an average response of 32.33. The 95% interval of this counterfactual prediction is [28.90, 35.24]. Subtracting this prediction from the observed response yields an estimate of the causal effect the intervention had on the response variable. This effect is -10.14 with a 95% interval of [-13.05, -6.72]. For a discussion of the significance of this effect, see below.
## 
## Summing up the individual data points during the post-intervention period (which can only sometimes be meaningfully interpreted), the response variable had an overall value of 110.91. By contrast, had the intervention not taken place, we would have expected a sum of 161.63. The 95% interval of this prediction is [144.51, 176.18].
## 
## The above results are given in terms of absolute numbers. In relative terms, the response variable showed a decrease of-31%. The 95% interval of this percentage is [-40%, -21%].
## 
## This means that the negative effect observed during the intervention period is statistically significant. If the experimenter had expected a positive effect, it is recommended to double-check whether anomalies in the control variables may have caused an overly optimistic expectation of what should have happened in the response variable in the absence of the intervention.
## 
## The probability of obtaining this effect by chance is very small (Bayesian one-sided tail-area probability p = 0.001). This means the causal effect can be considered statistically significant.

## During the post-intervention period, the response variable had an average value of approx. 31.53. In the absence of an intervention, we would have expected an average response of 31.07. The 95% interval of this counterfactual prediction is [27.49, 34.57]. Subtracting this prediction from the observed response yields an estimate of the causal effect the intervention had on the response variable. This effect is 0.46 with a 95% interval of [-3.05, 4.04]. For a discussion of the significance of this effect, see below.
## 
## Summing up the individual data points during the post-intervention period (which can only sometimes be meaningfully interpreted), the response variable had an overall value of 157.64. Had the intervention not taken place, we would have expected a sum of 155.35. The 95% interval of this prediction is [137.44, 172.87].
## 
## The above results are given in terms of absolute numbers. In relative terms, the response variable showed an increase of +1%. The 95% interval of this percentage is [-10%, +13%].
## 
## This means that, although the intervention appears to have caused a positive effect, this effect is not statistically significant when considering the entire post-intervention period as a whole. Individual days or shorter stretches within the intervention period may of course still have had a significant effect, as indicated whenever the lower limit of the impact time series (lower plot) was above zero. The apparent effect could be the result of random fluctuations that are unrelated to the intervention. This is often the case when the intervention period is very long and includes much of the time when the effect has already worn off. It can also be the case when the intervention period is too short to distinguish the signal from the noise. Finally, failing to find a significant effect can happen when there are not enough control variables or when these variables do not correlate well with the response variable during the learning period.
## 
## The probability of obtaining this effect by chance is p = 0.382. This means the effect may be spurious and would generally not be considered statistically significant.

## During the post-intervention period, the response variable had an average value of approx. -5.57. By contrast, in the absence of an intervention, we would have expected an average response of -5.72. The 95% interval of this counterfactual prediction is [-6.69, -4.81]. Subtracting this prediction from the observed response yields an estimate of the causal effect the intervention had on the response variable. This effect is 0.15 with a 95% interval of [-0.76, 1.12]. For a discussion of the significance of this effect, see below.
## 
## Summing up the individual data points during the post-intervention period (which can only sometimes be meaningfully interpreted), the response variable had an overall value of -27.85. By contrast, had the intervention not taken place, we would have expected a sum of -28.60. The 95% interval of this prediction is [-33.46, -24.04].
## 
## The above results are given in terms of absolute numbers. In relative terms, the response variable showed a decrease of-3%. The 95% interval of this percentage is [+13%, -20%].
## 
## This means that the negative effect observed during the intervention period is statistically significant. If the experimenter had expected a positive effect, it is recommended to double-check whether anomalies in the control variables may have caused an overly optimistic expectation of what should have happened in the response variable in the absence of the intervention.
## 
## The probability of obtaining this effect by chance is p = 0.377. This means the effect may be spurious and would generally not be considered statistically significant.

Reviewer Question: did the rate of decline change?


```r
# get annual changes
nullwt_lag <- nullwt %>%
  mutate(wtlag = wtRelative0_m - lag(wtRelative0_m))

# summarize for pre-lema ref period
nullwt_lag %>%
  filter(Year <= 2012 & Year > 2002) %>%
  summarize(mean(wtlag))
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 x 1

### function to pull data


```r

# combine and export
