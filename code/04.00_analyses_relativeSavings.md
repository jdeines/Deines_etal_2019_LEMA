Goal: Use derived data summaries to calculate relative proportion of water saved. May have some vestigial data processing copied from the 05.31_Figures_cropIrrChoices.Rmd, where this analysis originated.

# Calculate Relative Contributions
Approach estimates effects for the full 5 year period.

## Direct intensive margin

Direct intensive margin: water saved by less water per crop. LEMA-caused reductions taken from causal impact models in 03.00_analyses_cropWaterApplied.Rmd. Sorghum assumed to be zero given non-significant result.

Corn and soy are straightforward, since the area was reduced from pre-LEMA times. So all remaining corn and soy area counts as area over which the depth savings apply.

Sorghum - LEMA didn't save any water over sorghum, so only have to deal with sorghum in the indirect intensive margin.

Wheat is tough - existing area would get some direct intensive savings (44% at that!), but much of the post-LEMA wheat area is indirect from increase in area from previous soy/corn fields. Solution: replace wheat number with the pre-LEMA area... ultimately, the area of wheat is quite small, so this isn't a huge factor.

Water saved per crop per year: extract crop areas for Sheridan LEMA period and apply per-area crop savings from causalImpact model


```r
# join data for means and depths
cropKey$cropType <- c('Corn','Sorghum','Soybeans','WinterWheat') 
cropKey$ciSavings_cm <- c(8.6,0,5.8,8.7)

## Indirect Intensive Margin
Using post-LEMA irrigation depths (since we're talking about water saved during the LEMA period - essentially calculatig a hypothetical water volume that would have been used had crops not changed), compare water use for the mean crop mix (mean area of each crop) pre-LEMA and post-LEMA. This gives an annual estimate; multiple by number of years to get full effect.
